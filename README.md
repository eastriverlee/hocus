an open source keyboard-centric window manager / focus changer

## why 
conventional window managers, or macOS in general, lack an ability to change focus using keyboard shorcuts.  
so i present a hacky way to solve this.  
it works on multiple monitors setup.  
  
`hocus` exists to fill the gap, not to replace already available shortcuts.  
so it works best with original shortcuts like `` ⌘` ``(focus change within the same app) and `⌘⇥`(change app)

however, for user's convenience, hocus does provide some alias shortcuts.

## shortcuts
vim inspired shortcuts that correspond with certain words or arrows.
### focus change
* `⌃⌥⇢` next screen
* `⌃⌥⇠` previous screen
* `⌃⌥⇣` next window
* `⌃⌥⇡` previous window
* `⌃⌥␣` jump window (alias for `` ⌘` ``)
### window movement
* `⌃⌥.` move window to next screen
* `⌃⌥,` move window to previous screen
### window resize
* `⌃⌥[` left half
* `⌃⌥]` right half
* `⌃⌥p` primary (left 2/3)
* `⌃⌥s` secondary (right 1/3)
* `⌃⌥t` top (top 2/3)
* `⌃⌥b` bottom (bottom 1/3)
* `⌃⌥m` middle
* `⌃⌥=` toggle full screen (alias for `⌘⌃f`)
* `⌃⌥0` fill screen
* `⌃⌥1`…`⌃⌥9` 9 grid location

## disclaimer

*due to its unofficial nature, it would be no surprise if this doesn't work sometimes.*  
i personally, use this without any problems whatsoever, but maybe i'm not being objective. 

turning sandbox off makes this app unavailable to app store, which was necessary to get global keyboard input.  
'magnet' app could be an exception only becuase it was uploaded a long time ago when sandbox was optional.
